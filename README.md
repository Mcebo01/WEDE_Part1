Explanation of Fixes:
Navigation Menu: Created a nav with HTML links that function as anchor links within this single page to simulate smooth navigation. For a full multi-page set, duplicate the (header) and (nav) in separate files. This ensures links work across pages when implemented.

Base Style: Included a CSS reset and base styles (font-family, size, colors, background) applied to body for site-wide consistency.

Typography Styles: Applied font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height, and letter-spacing to headings and paragraphs. Used a simple scale for harmony.

Layout Structure: Used Flexbox for header/nav (flex-direction, justify-content, align-items). Used CSS Grid for main content (grid-template-areas, grid-template-columns) to create a desktop layout with hero, content, sidebar, and footer. Clear and navigable.

Visual Styles: Added color, background-color, border, box-shadow to elements. Used pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus, :active) on links and buttons for interactivity (e.g., color changes, underlines).

Responsive Design: Defined breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) with media queries. On larger screens: multi-column grid. On smaller: single-column, stacked nav/content, adjusted font sizes and padding. Navigation modifies to vertical on mobile/tablet.
